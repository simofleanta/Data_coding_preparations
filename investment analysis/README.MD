# Conclusions 

2007 is best year
Post money valuation is goes hand in had with raised amount as there is higher valuation where the amount raised is high.
worth looking at the economic context to see level of funding attraction
best amounts raised from series A+ followed by Angel
there is a weak correlation between post money valuation and ramount rasised 
the relationship between funding type and raised amounts shows which type of funding is more accessible. Series B and angel.
where there is lower amounts raised for other types of funding, there's less acess for ex. ventures and others. 
regplots show that types of funding reveal not only the type of company but also the amount of money companies can usually raiseusing the types of funding. 
worth checking domain of topic and type company.
