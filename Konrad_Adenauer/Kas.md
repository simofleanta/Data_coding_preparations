# Conclusions

The higher the number of libraries the higher the gdb. where the gdb is high the number of active readers in libraries is smaller most probabli because the number of workers increases. Culturally speaking people read when they have time, as reading is a leasure time activity instead of a part of the daily routine. Also there are new concepts linked to reading and libraries. Basically bookshops and interactive environments where people sit and read has largely substitued the tradaitionally known library. This encourages innovative approaches in increasing level of reading and educating among people.
