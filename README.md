You're submitting for a fixed-price project. While the majority of Upwork projects are completed successfully, please keep a few things in mind:

1. Escrow Protection is in place for fixed-price jobs
Before you start the project, you and the client must agree to requirements, a budget and milestones. Upwork charges the client at the beginning of the project, and the money for a milestone is deposited in escrow.

2. Escrow funded payments are released when the client approves work
When milestones are completed, the client can either approve work and release payment or request modifications to the work. Clients can also request that you approve the return of funds held in escrow.

3. Upwork offers mediation services
If you do the work and the client refuses to pay, Upwork can help mediate the dispute.

Please choose fixed-price jobs carefully. Only funds deposited for an active milestone are covered by Escrow Protection.
